## Flask Application Design

### HTML Files

- **index.html**:
  - This file serves as the main page of the application, where users can input the airline flight number and date.
  - It should contain a form with the necessary fields for user input (flight number, date), as well as a submit button.

### Routes

- **index**:
  - This route is associated with the **index.html** file.
  - It handles GET requests for the main page, displaying the form for user input.
- **sonnet**:
  - This route handles POST requests submitted from the form on **index.html**.
  - It should extract the flight number and date from the request, use them to generate a sonnet, and return the sonnet in the response.

### Application Structure

```python
# Import necessary modules
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
from sonnets import generate_sonnet

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/sonnet', methods=['POST'])
def sonnet():
    flight_number = request.form['flight_number']
    date = request.form['date']
    sonnet = generate_sonnet(flight_number, date)
    return sonnet

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

- The **sonnets.py** module contains the function **generate_sonnet**, which takes the flight number and date as input and generates a sonnet.
- The **app.py** file defines the Flask application and includes the two routes (/ and /sonnet).
- The application is configured to run in debug mode for convenience during development.
